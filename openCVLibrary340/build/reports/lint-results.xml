If the code using those APIs is called at runtime, then the program will crash.&#xA;&#xA;Furthermore, for permissions that are revocable (with `targetSdkVersion` 23), client code must also be prepared to handle the calls throwing an exception if the user rejects the request for permission at runtime."
